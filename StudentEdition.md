# Error in Prod | Adventure in DevOps

DevOps as a field is intimidating because of its high learning curve and general complexity, and when you search for more information you’re inundated with results for corporate webinars, jargon-filled tutorials, and complex diagrams.

That’s why New Relic is excited to partner with Bit Project, a tech education nonprofit, to introduce DevOps to students through an immersive learning experience called Error in Prod. The first workshop simulates a real-life on-call scenario for a site reliability engineer.

Leveraging New Relic, students will navigate through various simulated scenarios ranging from database outages to javascript errors to find and debug errors in production. Through the misguided adventures of D. Bug, the fictional villainous hacker infiltrating our simulated app, students will experience analyzing distributed traces, infrastructure data, and workloads through the New Relic UI.


We will have two live sessions of this workshop at FutureHack on the [New Relic Twitch Channel](twitch.tv/new_relic)
